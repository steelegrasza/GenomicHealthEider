# Common Eider Genomic Health Analysis
Introduction

This repository contains scripts and analyses for my thesis project on genomic health in common eiders (Somateria mollissima), with a focus on avian cholera resistance. My research aims to characterize genomic health by investigating differences between individuals that survived and those that died following a cholera outbreak at Mitivik (East Bay Island), Nunavut.
